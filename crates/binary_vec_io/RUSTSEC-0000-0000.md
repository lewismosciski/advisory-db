# Stack-based buffer overflow in binary_read_to_ref and binary_write_from_ref

The functions `binary_read_to_ref` and `binary_write_from_ref` are declared as safe but contain memory safety violations leading to stack-based buffer overflow.

Both functions accept a reference to a single value `&mut T` along with a count parameter `n`. When `n > 1`, they use `std::slice::from_raw_parts` or `std::slice::from_raw_parts_mut` to create a slice larger than the allocated stack memory, causing undefined behavior.

The issue allows reading or writing beyond allocated memory boundaries.
