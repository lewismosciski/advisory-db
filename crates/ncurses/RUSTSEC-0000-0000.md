# Soundness issue: Uninitialized memory exposure

Multiple functions improperly use `Vec::set_len()` and `String::set_len()`, setting the length to full capacity when no null terminator is found. This exposes uninitialized memory containing potentially sensitive data.

The ncurses-rs repository is archived and unmaintained. Users should migrate to maintained alternatives such as `crossterm` or `termion`.
